# H2_Salt_Cavern_Storage
H2 salt cavern storage capacity calculator for both offshore and onshore caverns (H2_Salt_Cavern_Storage_Capacity_Calculator_xlsm file).
Storage potential is thermodynamically derived, with respect to geomechanical and geospatial exclusions. 

H2 compressibility can alternatively be calculated using the H2_Compressibility_Factor_PyCode provided, which uses the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (EOS). 

The selected salt cavern geomechanical and spatial design can then be visialised using the Salt_Cavern_Design_PyCode provided.
